# HTML/CSS Webpage Project

## 📄 Overview

In this project, you will **build a fully functional web page from scratch**, using only **HTML** and **CSS**. The goal is to reproduce the final design as closely as possible using the skills you've learned in **HTML, CSS, accessibility, and responsive design**.

There is no strict step-by-step guide—this project encourages **creativity** and **autonomy**. Your implementation should match the design visually and functionally, but the structure of your code is up to you.
